In the index.html: 
There is a Sidebar serving as Navigation bar on the left side of the website, users can click the downward triangle button (▼) and expand the menu of sections they wish to jump to; it then switches to a upward triangle button which could be clicked and the drop-down menu will be hidden back again.
There is a two-downward triangle button (▼▼) floating at the bottom of the Header section, just indicating users could click to scroll down for more details on the website. It’s also clickable that just lead to the “About Me” section, while it’s already shown on the page. 
When each section is clicked through Sidebar or scroll down at, there is the AOS effect of fading in or zooming in/out, achieved through JS Plugins;
There is a Slideshow using JS Plugins in “Part B Section 2D - Interaction Plan and User Testing”, to show the pictures of prototype; 
There is a Floating window using JS effect, in “PART C - Reflection over the Final Product & Paper Review”. There is a button labeled as “Please Click to Read the Paper Review”. I did this in order to make the overall section looks a bit neater, as the text-box is getting really long. I figured to put the “Paper Review” section in a separate window should be reasonable. 


In the “js” folder, other than the plugin folder “tiny-slider”, I also include two JavaScript files: 
script.js for the Expand and Floating window, which are used in the index.html;
slideshow-script.js for the Slideshow used in the index.html;
